    <td>Hello PLC! It?s been a while since our last PLC, so we have a lot to cover in a short amount of time. We should be quicker than last meeting because we now all know the protocol. Today we need to rectify past events, and plan on doing better in the future. A basic rundown of what we&#39;re covering today:
<br/>Cleft rock hike SSC
<br/>Scout-O SSC
<br/>Last meeting SSC.
<br/>Meeting before last SSC
<br/>After that, we will cover some new business:
<br/>Communication problems
<br/>PLC Emails
<br/>How to contribute
<br/>Troop meeting deadlines
<br/>What about the themes?
<br/>Talking about the themes transitions to the final subject, our next troop meeting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>For those confused on the PLC procedure, we are using a <em>modified</em> version of Roberts Rules of Order. In a nutshell, that means we won&#39;t be using it all the time, and the SPL has more power to keep the meeting on track.

Ran outta water on cleft rock hike-- only real incident

Troop meeting plan was not in order, and could have been improved upon. Planning is the important part Teachers were not assigned



Mke meeting blocks shorter

Rylan:** Teachers should be someone who knows what they're doing--** the orienteering meeting, the teachers had no clue what to do.



The organization and planning of the last meeting was not optimal. Highly highly chaotic.



PLC Before the meeting



Communication avenu

Putting the stuff in the google docs does not help; it needs to be announced.
