We should be quicker than last meeting because we now all know the protocol. Today we need to rectify past events, and plan on doing better in the future. A basic rundown of what we're covering today: Cleft rock hike SSC Scout-O SSC Last meeting SSC. Meeting before last SSC After that, we will cover some new business: Communication problems PLC Emails How to contribute Troop meeting deadlines What about the themes? Talking about the themes transitions to the final subject, our next troop meeting. For those confused on the PLC procedure, we are using a modified version of Roberts Rules of Order. In a nutshell, that means we won't be using it all the time, and the SPL has more power to keep the meeting on track.` |
