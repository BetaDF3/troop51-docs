Tonight?s PLC will cover several important items under both old and new business. For old business, we will focus on reviewing our last two troop meetings using SSC to help identify improvements we can act on. For new business, we will use our modified RRoO format to make decisions for upcoming meetings.



During the Call to Order, scouts will have a chance to bring up any topics they want added to the agenda. Please think ahead about items your patrols want addressed so their input can be represented clearly.** **
