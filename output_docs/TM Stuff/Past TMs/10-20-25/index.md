**station 1 \- maps & symbols on map/landmarks, steps counting**  
Maps are a very important tool when trying to navigate from one location to another. It informs the user of obstacles that they may face along the way and also the safest route. However with any tool, maps are only useful when the user knows how to interpret it. There are also many types of maps; however, while outdoors, the map of choice is the topographical map.  
**The Grid**  
The first item you would notice when reading a map is that there are lines that form a grid on the surface; this is formed by the longitude and latitude lines. Longitude lines are lines that run from north to south that measure degree from the prime meridian whereas the latitude lines are lines that run from east to west that measure the degree from the equator. Just like a graph in math class, by knowing the x and y coordinates, a user can pinpoint their exact location on the map.  
**Colors and Symbols**  
To help the user quickly identify obstacles and resources on the map, mapmakers have devised a color schema and legend for quick references. The color scheme is illustrated below:  
Black \- Man-made features such as roads, buildings, etc.  
Blue \- Water, lakes, rivers, streams, etc.  
Green \- Areas with substantial vegetation (could be forest, scrub, etc.)  
Brown \- Contour lines  
Red \- Major highways; boundaries of public land areas  
White \- Areas with little or no vegetation; white is also used to depict permanent snowfields and glaciers                                                                                            
**Contour Lines**  
Contour lines, also known as isolines, are the squiggly lines on the map that show the elevation and the constant height of curves. With elevation and curves’ height, they represent the slope of a mountain or hill. Once the contour lines have been identified, the user can determine the different elevation changes that lie between them and their target. More importantly, the scout can determine the extremity of the change. The closer together the contour lines are, the more extreme the change, and while there is more space between the lines, the gentler the change. The image to the left illustrates the different scenarios associated with contour lines.  
This lets you see the depth of two-dimensional top down views.

**Step Counting:** A pace is the distance covered by two steps or a normal walk. This is used to estimate the distance traveled in a certain direction. It can also be used to estimate the height or width of objects. Users can easily determine their pace by conducting the following exercise: Measure out a distance of 100 feet. This can be done with a 100 foot rope or a measuring tape. Starting with your left foot at the end of the rope, walk towards the end of the 100 foot marker. Count the number of times your right foot hits the ground. Each time your right foot hits the ground is considered 1 pace. Once completed, divide 100 by the number of paces. This is your distance per pace. For example if you took 20 paces, your distance per pace would be 5 feet (100 feet divided by 20 paces).

**Types and Parts of Compasses**  
A compass can allow scouts to orientate a map and help identify features on the landscape. The question remains, how do I select the best compass for me? There are many different types of compasses out there all with their own uses, specialties, and cost. This section breaks down different compasses and also the parts that make up the compass.

- Accessory Compass \- These are compasses that are normally found on key chains and flashlights. While they do point to magnetic North, these should not replace a basic compass or be used as part of a Scout’s Ten Essentials. If I say bring a compass, and you bring one of these, you're not meeting the requirements.  
- Basic Compass \- Basic compasses are, as their name implies, a compass with basic functionality, and do not have the bells and whistles like the more advanced models do. This is a good choice for Scouts that are just starting out and would not use the more advanced functions.  
- Advanced Compass \- Advanced models are fully loaded and come with many different tools that make navigation easier and more accurate. These tools include magnifying glass, mirror, and declination adjustment which the basic compasses lack.

**Parts of a compass**  
Whichever model you decide on using, you must know the different parts of the compass and know what each item does before you can use the compass. The section below breaks down the different parts of a compass and also gives an explanation to what each item does.

1.  **Magnetic Needle** – The magnetic needle is the needle that floats in liquid, spins around, and finds magnetic North. This needle is normally red and white with the red portion pointing north; different variations may exist.  
2.  **Capsule** – The capsule is the housing that houses the liquid and the magnetic needle.  
3.  **Rotating** **Bezel** – Also known as an azimuth ring is the rotating dial that is marked with degrees from 0 to 360\. The ring is used by the user to input the direction of travel, or degree, which is relative to magnetic north.  
4.  **Base** **Plate** – The base plate is the base that the capsule sits upon. Some compasses also have the magnifying glass and ruler built into the base plate which is extremely helpful when measuring distances on a map or drawing a bearing.  
5.  **Orienteering** **Arrow** – The orienteering arrow is a drawn arrow located on the bottom of the capsule. The arrow on the bottom of the capsule is used to align the user to the direction of travel and is normally paired with meridian lines which are used to orient the compass to the map.  
6.  **Direction** **of** **Travel** – The direction of travel is the large arrow that is printed on the edge of the base plate. As the name implies, after the compass has been calibrated to a specific degree, the direction of travel points to the bearing that it is configured to.  
7.  **Magnifying** **Lens** – Certain compasses have magnifying lenses built into the base plate that allows the user to read maps easier.

These are just some basic parts of a compass. There are compasses that posses more parts and some with less parts. The image above is a sample of where these and other parts of a compass would be located.

**Goals: Make sure every scout knows their pace count and how to effectively and efficiently read maps, name most parts of the compass, and the different types of compasses.**  
**station 2 \- compasses & distance estimation, bearings**  
During the journey, it is important to always keep your bearings and also check your map often. It is important to make sure you are heading towards the correct bearing instead of just the general direction. You’ve seen bearing mentioned multiple times, so what is a bearing?

A bearing is a measurement of direction between 2 points and is normally given by a degree. There are many ways to obtain a bearing, with two being the most common. The first method is to obtain a bearing using a given landmark, such as a hill or a tree. The second is to find a bearing between two objects on a map. The section below breaks down the steps for each method.

**Bearing of a Landmark**  
To obtain a bearing of a landmark, follow these simple steps:  
Point the Direction of Travel arrow to the landmark you would like to obtain the bearing for. Rotate the bezel until the magnetic needle is “boxed” within the Orienteering Arrow. The bearing for the landmark is the degree under the Direction of Travel.

**Bearing using two points on a map**  
To obtain a bearing between two points on a map, ensure that the map has been properly oriented. Once oriented, follow the procedures below:  
Locate the two points in which you would like to obtain the bearing for and draw a straight line connecting both points. Align the line drawn on the map with the Direction of Travel arrow on your compass. Rotate the bezel until the magnetic needle is “boxed” within the Orienteering Arrow. Note: Do not move the map as the map has already been oriented. The bearing between the two points is the degree under the Direction of Travel.  
Orienting the map should be the first step in determining the bearing; however if this was not done, the user must compensate for magnetic declination. The declination value must be added or subtracted from the bearing depending on your location.

**Other Orienteering Techniques**  
Aside from obtaining your bearing, there are other techniques that would allow the scout to stay on track and reduce the risk of getting lost. These techniques are noted below:  
Attack Point  
Handrails  
Thumbing  
Points of Three

**Attack Points**  
While similar to an bearing, an attack point allows the scout to focus more on landmarks instead of a degree. Attack points are permanent landmarks that are easily identifiable on the ground. These could be manmade items such as bridges and buildings, or nature such as waterfalls, or mountains. It should be stressed that attack points be used in conjunction with bearings as scouts may select a landmark such as a mountain and hike towards a different mountain because their step was off and was confused because the mountain around the area all look the same.

**Handrails**  
Handrails or Hand-railing as the technique is called, is a technique used by scouts that are required to keep a fast pace or is in a situation where attack points could not be used, such as fog. Hand-railing utilizes the existing features of the environment and allows the scouts to follow the feature to prevent straying from the target. This may require the scout to cover more ground, but because the scout will not be required to check their bearing, it also allows the scout to move at a quicker pace. This method can be used on the following features:  
Rivers  
Canyons  
Paths or Roads  
Overhead Wires  
Edge of Forests  
Cliff Edges

The technique is extremely easy to implement, but the scout should implement this method prior to starting their trek. The scout should plot out their trek on a map and ensure they are at the current location. In addition, while using this technique, scouts should also identifying different attack points along the trek to ensure they are on the proper path. Without the use of Attack Points, scouts may overshoot their target and loose valuable time.

**Thumbing**  
While the techniques mentioned above are used while the scout is traveling, the thumbing technique is a technique that is used on the map. The purpose of the thumbing technique is to identify the scout’s last known location to prevent the scout from losing their location on their map. In order to use this technique, the map would have to be folded so only a small location is exposed. The scout will then place their thumb on their location before traveling to the next location. Once they have arrived, the scout can use their previous location which is being marked with the scout’s thumb as a reference to determine if they are off.

**Points of Three**  
Traveling in a straight line in the wilderness is extremely hard. Individuals pacing will change while they are traveling and may steer off their original bearing. The easiest way to check and correct for this is following the Points of Three technique. This is an extremely easy technique and can be deployed when the scout is traveling. When a scout is required to travel in a straight line, whether on an orienteering course or in the wilderness, the scout can check whether they are traveling in a straight line by locating the following items.  
Locate the attack target – (Let's call this Point A.)  
Locate the scout’s original position – (Let's call this Point C)  
Ensure that the scout (Let's call this Point B) is aligned with Point A and Point C which will ensure the scout is on a straight line.

The is an extremely easy technique that can be implemented quickly and easily and acts as a simple check to ensure the scout is traveling in a straight line. This is extremely important as we do not walk in a straight line and even a small degree of error can add to distance between the scout and their target.

**station 3 \- practice course**  
You will now put together everything you learned and put it in action. An Orienteering Course has been set up, and you are to run it, you are fully prepared for our next campout. There will be little electrical pipes with orange rope, and they will be very visible. Note that **there will be fake points**, so you have to follow the directions\!
