**`KNOTS 1`**

| `Square Knot  Left over right Go around Right over left Go around Pull tight Timber Hitch![][image9] Pass the rope around the log or object. Bring the working end around the standing part. Pass the working end around itself once so it forms a loop. Wrap the working end tightly around the standing part 3–4 times. Pull the standing part to snug the wraps; the hitch tightens under load. (Optional) Add a half hitch or two on the standing part for extra security.` | `Clove Hitch Make an X on the pole Put the end of the rope under the X and pull tight  Bowline ![][image10] Make a loop Go through the hole Go around the non looped part Go back through the first hole Pull tight  Two Half Hitches Wrap the rope around a rod Pass the end through the loop Wrap it around the taut part, looping into itself Pull tight` |

**`KNOTS 2`**

| `Taut-Line Hitch![][image11] Wrap the rope around a pole and make a loop Make 2 inside wraps and 1 outside wrap Pull tight then slide the knot along the standing part to adjust tension  Sheet Bend ![][image12] Make a loop with the thick rope, and put the thin rope through it Bring the thin rope under and around Put the thin rope under itself and pull tight` | `Trucker’s Hitch ![][image13] Tie a small slip knot in the middle of the rope Run the working end around the anchor point. Pass it through the loop to make a pulley. Pull tight to tension the line. Secure with two Half Hitches.  Trucker’s Hitch - Tips Instead of the carabiner it can be any cylindrical support like a tree trunk, etc. It can be finished off with a taut line hitch. Less prone to slipping than the latter. Because the common variations of the hitch use the loop in the standing part and the anchor point as makeshift pulleys, it gives a mechanical advantage of 2:1 if you're pulling at the working end. The knot may be secured with a double half hitch along one or both lines.` |
