**`Knots 1`**

| `Square Knot  Left over right Go around Right over left Go around Pull tight Timber Hitch![][image9] Pass the rope around the log or object. Bring the working end around the standing part. Pass the working end around itself once so it forms a loop. Wrap the working end tightly around the standing part 3–4 times. Pull the standing part to snug the wraps; the hitch tightens under load. (Optional) Add a half hitch or two on the standing part for extra security.` | `Clove Hitch Make an X on the pole Put the end of the rope under the X and pull tight  Bowline ![][image14] Make a loop Go through the hole Go around the non looped part Go back through the first hole Pull tight  Two Half Hitches Wrap the rope around a rod Pass the end through the loop Wrap it around the taut part, looping into itself Pull tight` |

**`Knots 2`**

| `Taut-Line Hitch![][image15] Wrap the rope around a pole and make a loop Make 2 inside wraps and 1 outside wrap Pull tight then slide the knot along the standing part to adjust tension  Sheet Bend ![][image12] Make a loop with the thick rope, and put the thin rope through it Bring the thin rope under and around Put the thin rope under itself and pull tight` | `Trucker’s Hitch ![][image16] Tie a small slip knot in the middle of the rope Run the working end around the anchor point. Pass it through the loop to make a pulley. Pull tight to tension the line. Secure with two Half Hitches.  Trucker’s Hitch - Tips Instead of the carabiner it can be any cylindrical support like a tree trunk, etc. It can be finished off with a taut line hitch. Less slipping than the latter. Because the variations of the hitch use the loop in the standing part and the anchor point as pulleys, it gives a mechanical advantage of 2:1 if you're pulling at the working end. The knot can be secured with a double half hitch on one/both lines` |
