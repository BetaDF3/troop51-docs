LESSON PLAN

**Materials**

Bring tinder, kindling, and fuel. Not too much.

**Requirements** 

Second Class  
2a. Explain when it is appropriate to use a fire for cooking or other  
purposes and when it would not be appropriate to do so.  
2c. At an approved outdoor location and time, use the tinder,  
kindling, and fuel wood from Second Class requirement 2b to  
demonstrate how to build a fire. Unless prohibited by local fire  
restrictions, light the fire. After allowing the flames to burn safely  
for at least two minutes, safely extinguish the flames with  
minimal impact to the fire site. 

**Firem’n Chit Reqs.**

**The purpose of this lesson is not requirements, but to actually teach about fire safety**.

That means teachers, patrol leaders, don't just read off the book. Make logical questions about things that could really happen, so at a campout, we have no safety issues. Cover everything, not just what's in the book. That means putting out the fire, starting fires, the fire danger level, and the job of the fire guard at normal camps and at scout camp.

**Lesson Plan**

**Group Demo**  
Start with the outdoor code. Have a volunteer list it off. Then ask a scout which they would say is the most important, and why. When one of them gets to be careful with fire, explain how dangerous fire can be. Don't just talk about how dangerous it is, ask a scout about the good things fire can do, and note that fire is a very useful resource. Ask scouts what they think are the most important fire safety rules. Guide them into the rules below

**Main Ideas**

I have read and understand use and safety rules from the Scouts BSA Handbook.

I will build a campfire only when necessary and when I have the necessary permits (regulations vary by locality).

I will minimize campfire impacts or use existing fire lays consistent with the principles of Leave No Trace. I will check to see that all flammable material is cleared at least 5 feet in all directions from fire (total 10 feet).

I will safely use and store fire-starting materials.

I will see that fire is attended to at all times.

I will make sure that water and/or a shovel is readily available. I will promptly report any wildfire to the proper authorities.

I will use the cold-out test to make sure the fire is cold out and will make sure the fire spot is cleaned before I leave it.

I follow the Outdoor Code, the Guide to Safe Scouting, and the principles of 

Leave No Trace and Tread Lightly\!

**I have read and understand use and safety rules from the Scouts BSA Handbook.**

Fire is not a toy. Never remove hot sticks from a fire to throw or wave around, especially near others.  
Any lit fires must be attended at all times (by at least 1 responsible person).  
Any ‘fires’ (even smoldering coals) that are not cold to the touch are considered ‘lit,’ and can’t be left unattended.  
Keep at least 2 water buckets or a fire extinguisher readily available near any fire.  
Never light matches or ignite a flame within a tent. It’s super, super dangerous\!  
Clear at least 5 feet of vegetation around any fire you build.  
Never light fires around the base of living trees or on grass. Instead, use a fire pit or other designated areas.  
Don't try to move wood in the pit with your hands. Instead, get a poker stick, and thoroughly waterlog it so it wont ketch. Do not leave the poker stick in the fire. Re-wet the stick as needed.

Make sure they remember this list as they continue earning their Firem’n Chit. It should serve as the foundation of their fire safety knowledge\!

**Propane, Stove, and Lantern Fire Safety Rules**

Like fire, propane should also be used with caution, as it’s an extremely common, highly flammable fuel used by Scouts. Below are a few important safety tips to keep in mind when using propane or propane-powered tools:

**Make sure that all gas connections are well-tightened (but no need to over-tighten with tools). \-** Often, propane tasks are lefty-tighty, righty-loosen.

**Ensure all gas connections are fully secured and that there are no leaks-** You can do this by putting a bit of soapy water on the connections – small bubbles will form over any leaks\!

**When lighting a propane stove/lantern, strike any matches/lighters before turning on the gas.**

**Make sure all gas-powered items like stoves and lanterns are positioned on a stable, non-meltable surface.**

**Never leave a lit stove or lantern unattended.**

**Let your equipment completely cool before putting it away.**

**Make sure that propane canisters are properly sealed and stored away**   
**from open flames or excess heat. They could explode\! \-** In any situation, never ever place propane canisters near an open flame.

Now that they know the main fire safety rules for both campfires and propane, the rest of earning the Firem’n Chit should be easy. In the next few sections, they will be learning some of the ethics around fire, as well as more safety tips to avoid starting forest fires.

**2\) I will build a campfire only when necessary and when I have the necessary permits (regulations vary by locality).**

While campfires are a lot of fun to sit around, we shouldn’t build them all the time. There is a time and a place for everything, especially fires. **Many locations (and/or seasons) have regulations around when and how you can build a fire while camping.**

So, before you even begin thinking about getting out the matches, tinder, and kindling, make sure that you know the fire rules for your area. Below are a few examples of when it’s illegal or dangerous to build a fire:

\-During Dry Season or in Heavy Winds  
\-In Fire Restricted Areas  
\-If It’s Only For Fun and Outside a Fire Pit  
\-If You’re Burning Dangerous Materials  
\-When Building a Fire Without a Permit

These rules are put in place to prevent campers from starting forest fires. Uncontrolled blazes can devastate natural resources and even kill innocent people. At times, a campfire may not be safe to light due to hazardous wind conditions.

SIDE NOTE:  
\-  
As Scouts, we’re trained and prepared to stay warm and prepare food without a campfire. In fact, there are plenty of other ways to cook or stay warm without lighting fires (such as hand warmers, electric heaters, stoves, propane, etc)\!

Also, even if in an area with fire restrictions, most of the time you have to purchase a permit from your county to legally light a campfire\! Leaders should contact campsite authorities to ask whether a restriction is in place and if you can purchase a permit for the trip. (for leaders)  
\-  
**3\) I will minimize campfire impacts or use existing fire lays consistent with the principles of Leave No Trace. I will check to see that all flammable material is cleared at least 5 feet in all directions from fire (total 10 feet).**

One of the biggest parts of Scouting is Leave No Trace. This mindset helps us preserve the Earth’s natural resources for our children and future generations. Leave No Trace is especially important when it comes to fires as they can easily damage areas.

Here’s a quick recap of the essential Leave No Trace principles:

\-Plan Ahead and Prepare  
\-Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces  
\-Dispose of Waste Properly  
\-Leave What You Find  
\-Minimize Campfire Impacts  
\-Respect Wildlife  
\-Be Considerate of Other Visitors

While all of these principles are extremely important, the thing they need to focus on today is Minimizing Campfire Impacts. The principle of minimizing campfire impacts focuses on reducing environmental damage and resource usage when building a fire.

Finally, do not keep anything flammable near a fire. Anything that could explode (propane, lighter fluid, etc.) should be kept far away. Clothes and chemical items shouldn’t be near a fire either. Even if they aren’t flammable, they can still create dangerous fumes that harm you and the environment.

**4\) I will safely use and store fire-starting materials.**

There are plenty of items you can use to start a fire, but some of them can be extremely dangerous. These fire-starting materials need to be stored safely in order to protect your fellow Scouts, as well as to make sure they’re usable for future outings.

Below are a few examples of common fire-starting materials:

\-Lighter Fluid  
\-Dryer Lint/Dry FireStarter  
\-Matches  
\-Flint and Steel  
\-Tinder (the smallest type of firestarter: usually pencil-sized twigs, or smaller)  
\-Kindling (medium-sized firestarter: branches about as thick as your thumb and as long as your arm)  
\-Fuel/Firewood (the largest type of firestarter: dry wood that’s wrist-thickness or larger)

While not every single one of these is prone to exploding, all of them need to be stored safely. Lighter fluid is especially important to store safely, as a simple spark can set it alight.

QUICK TAKE FOR SCOUTS

Lighter fluid should always be stored somewhere cool, where it cannot come into contact with excessive heat or any kind of open flame. Using too much lighter fluid can also cause explosions and unexpected flare-ups, so use as little as possible.

When using lighter fluid, it should be applied to something like newspaper or kindling, instead of being sprayed directly into a fire. This is much safer, and will also help to conserve your lighter fluid.

\---

Other fire-starting materials are a little simpler to store. These just need to be kept in a cool, dry area to ensure that they’re still useful when you need them. Never use those in excess either. This saves resources for future outings and prevents disasters — such as a giant, uncontrollable fire\!

**5\) I will see that fire is attended to at all times.**

This is a pretty easy principle to follow, but it is extremely important and often overlooked. A fire should never be left unattended. As a responsible Scout, whenever you build a fire, you stay by that fire until it’s out (or assign someone trustworthy to watch it).

The main reason that you shouldn’t leave a fire unattended is that it can spread without your knowledge. This can cause a forest fire and burn down your campsite\! Once a fire gets out of control and spreads, it’s almost impossible to reclaim that control by yourself.

Leaving a fire unattended can lead to some huge consequences. So, **whenever you build a fire, never leave it unattended\!\!**

**6\) I will make sure that water and/or a shovel is readily available. I will promptly report any wildfire to the proper authorities.**

Having water and a shovel nearby any fire is extremely important. If your fire starts getting out of control, you’ll need to react fast. Here’s what shovels and water can do to help fight fires:

\-A shovel is great for burying the fire, smothering it, and stopping its spread.  
\-Water is great for dousing the burning fuel, which should put small wood fires out almost immediately. Water can also be used to make a poker stick, used by the fire guard to tend the fire.

You should also pour water over a fire you decide to smother. Putting dirt over burning logs will stop the flames, but the area will remain very hot for hours afterward. You should never leave the site of a fire while it’s still warm.

SCOUTS QUICK TAKE:

If you notice a fire is spreading and beyond control, contact emergency services immediately. Whether it’s your fire or not doesn’t matter — call 911\!

Every second counts when containing fires, so it’s better to take precautions than to risk even more damage and injury. Making sure the firefighters are on their way is a good way to mitigate the worst-case scenario if you’re unable to control a spreading fire.  
We’ll go over how to tell if your fire is completely out in the next step, but always remember that using a shovel and water are your best friends when putting out a fire.

**7\) I will use the cold-out test to make sure the fire is cold out and will make sure the fire spot is cleaned before I leave it.**

The cold-out test is essential for determining if your fire is actually out or not. Often, fires that could reignite and spread look like they’re out for hours\! Plus, the cold-out test is easy to perform, as you’re simply touching the ash in your fire to see if it’s still hot.

Make sure to give your muddy campfire soup some time to cool off before performing the cold-out test to avoid burning yourself. Here’s the best and safest method I’ve found for performing the cold-out test.

1- Hold your hand about 6 inches over the entire area of the fire pit to see if it’s radiating heat.  
2- Move your hand slowly around to see if there are any hot patches.  
3- Then, stir the wet coals around one more time and feel over the area again.  
4- If you notice any hot areas, stir them into the water.  
5- If you don’t notice any warm areas, the area isn’t a fire hazard and should be safe to touch\!

Be careful to watch for burning embers, even when doing the cold-out test. If you see a glow coming from the fire pit, the fire is not out. You should wait until there is no smoke or light coming from the fire before touching the ash to see if it’s cold.

PRO TIP:

In my own experience, even when using water a fire can reignite. I have “put out” multiple campfires that have reignited again before the pit had a chance to fully go cold. The cold-out test prevents that risk\! \-timmy

Once your fire is cold, remove all of the debris. The ash can stay, but half-burned logs and other trash should be taken out and properly disposed of. This follows the Leave No Trace principles, as all traces of your fire, except the pit, are cleaned up and removed\!  
**8\) I follow the Outdoor Code, the Guide to Safe Scouting, and the principles of Leave No Trace and Tread Lightly\!**

Now that we’re reaching the end of teaching for the **Scouts BSA Firem’n Chit (or as most Scouts miscall it, the Fireman Chip)**, it’s time to incorporate different Scouting outdoor principles into your fire building\! We’ve already discussed Leave No Trace, so I’ll run through the other ones here.

Let’s start with the Outdoor Code: (find a scout to say this from memory)

As an American, I will do my best to –

Be clean in my outdoor manners.

Be careful with fire.

Be considerate in the outdoors.

Be conservation minded.

This is just a great code to live by, whether you’re a Scout or not. The Outdoor Code reminds Scouts to be mindful while on outings and respect the natural wonders we enjoy as Scouts.

**The Guide to Safe Scouting**  
The Guide to Safe Scouting is much longer than the Outdoor Code, but should still be read and followed at all times. It’s basically a tiny book that talks about the safety guidelines for almost every Scouting activity you can think of.

**The BSA offers an online version that you should read thoroughly before completing the Firem’n Chit. The Guide To Safe Scouting covers almost everything you could encounter on an outing, which will prepare you well for your future adventures\!**

**Tread Lightly**  
Finally, Tread Lightly. Tread Lightly is a non-profit and BSA partner that promotes responsibility out in the wilderness. They have their own principles which should help you on an outing (which spells out TREAD):

\-Travel Responsibly  
\-Respect the Rights of Others  
\-Educate Yourself  
\-Avoid Sensitive Areas  
\-Do Your Part

These Tread Lightly principles follow closely with other lessons we learn from Scouting, but they’re still important to consider when you’re out and about in the wilderness. By following all of these principles, you now are equipped to handle fire safely, ethically, and responsibly\!
