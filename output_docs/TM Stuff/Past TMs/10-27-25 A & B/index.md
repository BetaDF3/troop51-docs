LESSON PLAN



**FIRST AID **

Have Cub Scouts fill out the Emergency Contact Information worksheet. Discuss where this might be placed in their home for easy access. Explain to Cub Scouts what they should do when encountering an emergency that requires first aid:

Check. Make sure the scene is safe before approaching. You can?t help anyone if you become a victim yourself.

Calm down and think. Take a couple of seconds to assess the situation and decide what needs to be done. Staying calm may be hard to do, but it?s important. The victim will feel better knowing you are in control, and you will be able to make better decisions than if you were panicked.

Call. If the victim seems badly hurt, send someone to call for medical help. If no one is there to do that, call for help and offer to assist the victim.

Care. Explain that you know first aid and get permission to treat the victim before doing anything else. When sending someone to get help, point at a specific person and say something like, ?Juan, go call 911 and ask for an ambulance.? Don?t assume everybody knows what to do.

Do not move a badly hurt person unless they are in further danger. It may be necessary to move a person if there is a nearby fire or if the person is lying in the road. But never move an injured person unless it is absolutely necessary. Check the victim for ?hurry cases.?

Treat the victim for shock.

Have one Cub Scout be the victim and the other Cub Scout be the responder. An older scout will be the victim in need of first aid. Tell Cub Scouts that as buddies they come upon the ?victim? and must act out what they should do.

**SERVICE PROJECT PLANING **

Hand out the SAFE Service Project Planning Checklist and a pen or pencil to each Cub Scout.

Explain to Cub Scouts that they?re going to make a plan for conducting a service project in a safe manner. Allow lots of creativity or scouts to actually plan a project.

Ask Cub Scouts to think of a service project they could do for the community. Have them write a description of the project on their checklist.

Next, have Cub Scouts brainstorm the steps that would need to be taken to complete the project. Have them write the steps on their checklist.

Explain what SAFE means:

Supervision- supervised by qualified and trustworthy adults who set the example for safety

Assessment- Activities are assessed for risk during planning

Fitness and Skills- Annual Health and Medical Records are reviewed, and leaders have confirmed that prerequisite fitness and skill levels exist for participants to take part safely.

Equipment and Environment- Safe and appropriately sized equipment, courses, camps, campsites, trails, or playing fields are used properly.

For each point of SAFE ask Cub Scouts to think about their project. What needs to happen to ensure each point of the checklist is met?

If there is a point that Cub Scouts can?t check off, ask them if there?s a way to do the project more safely. Explain that if they can?t think of a way to do it more safely, they will have to choose another service project.

**CAMPING **

Have some paper and get as creative as you want.

Include:

Location

Time

Food

What your bringing

How your getting there

You can plan a trip to stay in the sun if you want, just have fun.

**DETAILS **

The AOLs will be here today? we need to show them what BSA is all about!

The AOLs will be mixed into the existing patrols \(_for now_\), and this will hopefully balance out the amount of people per patrol.

Covered below is how to instruct the activities for **Patrol Leaders,** and for **Instructors, **the lesson plan on knots.

**PATROL LEADERS - 6:50-7:05 **

Since there is not much to do right now, we are going to do our meal plan for the next campout, and also come up with some recommendations for the next meetings.



**INSTRUCTORS - 6:50-7:05 **

The AOLs do not really know their knots too well. You will instruct them the square knot, taut-line hitch, bowline, and possibly some extra knots if you are equipped to teach them and think they will improve the time. Explain how the game works \(briefly\) and alert SPL or ASPLs when done.



**PATROL LEADERS - 7:05-7:30**

The Tie Down Relay is a fun game that combines fun with knot learning.

Keep in mind this is aimed to be really fun and simple for the AOLs



**How It Works **

The Tie Down Relay works like this:

Pick a kid that wants the be the ?escape artist? \(pick someone willing to be tied down to a chair\)

Pick 4 tiers and four untires

Line the 8 scouts up, 8 feet away from the ?escape artists? chair.

Start a stopwatch, and send one scout up at a time to tie 1 limb at a time to the chair

When all 4 limbs are tied, have the escape artist try to escape. If he can, start over, if not, proceed to step 6

Send 1 untier at a time to untie 1 limb at a time

When the escape artist is untied, he should run to the other scouts

Stop the stopwatch

At the end of this block, hand this meeting plan to Timmy with your stopwatch times written legibly somewhere on it? make sure to include the patrol name so I can judge them later. The patrol with the quickest time gets a prize.
