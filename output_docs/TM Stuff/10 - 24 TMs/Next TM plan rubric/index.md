Knots: Colten

Knives: Matt



There will be 4 stations, each scout will do two now, and the remaining two at the next TM.



We need to finalize:



-The instructors: Four teachers, two for each subject-- Make sure they are qualified.



-The Materials: List what's needed for each skill and who will bring the materials



-The Content: Include what will be taught at each session and a rough time plan to help manage pacing.



-Tracking: It would be nice to create a sign-off sheet \(Google Sheets works well\) listing the skills covered in each session and who completed them, so adults can easily track progress.
