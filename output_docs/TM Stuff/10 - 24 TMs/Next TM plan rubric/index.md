# 💠 Next TM plan rubric

`Knots: Colten`  
`Knives: Matt`

`There will be 4 stations, each scout will do two now, and the remaining two at the next TM.`

`We need to finalize:`

`-The instructors: Four teachers, two for each subject-- Make sure they are qualified.`

`-The Materials: List what's needed for each skill and who will bring the materials`

`-The Content: Include what will be taught at each session and a rough time plan to help manage pacing.`

`-Tracking: It would be nice to create a sign-off sheet (Google Sheets works well) listing the skills covered in each session and who completed them, so adults can easily track progress.`
