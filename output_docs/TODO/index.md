`Other things to note:`  
`If possible, I want to do the scout olympics thing mentioned by Mr. Logan, because it will help stray from the repetitive nature of our meetings`  
`This would span multiple meetings, and would have a definitive winner.`  
`If we decide to do this, we need to decide what size teams we are going to have, if they are going to be mixed patrol or not, and tournament style. That's not all, there's more things to be specified, but this should only be looked further upon if we decide to do this.`

`If we can work together efficiently we can get 2 meetings done in one week, which will put us on the right track, instead of how we have been (working on it the same week 👎)`

`Broader issues:`

- `What about the themes? They are done!!`  
- `What will we do about whole-troop communication?`

`🕇I need everyone's emails, and they need to fill out the google form— Google Forms` 

`For those who need the calendar, go to google calendar and find “subscribe to calender”.`  
`The email is t51manomet@gmail.com`
