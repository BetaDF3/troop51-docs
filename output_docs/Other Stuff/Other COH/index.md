\[Turning to the retiring Committee Chair\]



ScoutMaster:  Before we begin our awards ceremony, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our retiring Committee Chair.

Today, we gather not just to acknowledge the passage of time, but to celebrate the remarkable tenure of Jan Fien, our esteemed committee chair at Troop 51. For several years, Jan has been the backbone of our troop, dedicating herself tirelessly to its growth and success.



In the world of scouting, it's easy to overlook the immense effort that goes on behind the scenes. But for us, Jan has been the orchestrator of it all, ensuring that every aspect of troop operations runs smoothly. From her weekly newsletters that kept us informed and inspired, to her pivotal role in policy matters and Committee meetings, Jan has been the steady hand guiding our ship.



But Jan's contributions extend far beyond the duties outlined in the committee chair's job description. She's been the architect of countless trips and activities, organizing adventures that have created lasting memories for our scouts. Her dedication, creativity, and passion have left an indelible mark on Troop 51, shaping its identity and fostering a spirit of camaraderie among our members.



As Jan embarks on a new chapter of her life, it's clear that her legacy will endure. Troop 51 stands as a testament to her vision and leadership, thriving under her guidance. Her goal was simple yet profound: to make Troop 51 not just survive, but to thrive. And by the sheer number of scouts who have found a home here, it's evident that she has succeeded beyond measure.



So let us take a moment to express our gratitude to Jan Fien, for her unwavering dedication, her boundless enthusiasm, and her steadfast commitment to Troop 51. Though she may be stepping down from her role, her influence will continue to shape our troop for years to come. Jan, you will be dearly missed, but your spirit will forever remain at the heart of Troop 51.  \[Turning to the retiring Committee Chair\] .Please join me in thanking Jan Fien for her service.



\[Applause fills the room as the retiring Committee Chair stands and receives a round of applause.\]



ScoutMaster: And now, as we bid farewell to one leader, we welcome another. I am pleased to introduce \[Incoming Committee Chair's Mrs. Kate Hartley, who will be taking on the important role of guiding our troop into the future. \[Turning to the incoming Committee Chair\] Welcome, \[Incoming Committee Chair's Name\], we look forward to working with you and continuing to uphold the values of scouting.



\[The audience applauds as the incoming Committee Chair stands and acknowledges the warm welcome.\]



Master of Ceremonies: Now, onto the heart of tonight's ceremony ? recognizing the achievements of our Scouts. It's my honor to announce Mr. Ronald Enhes to announce the recipients of merit badges and rank advancements earned throughout the year.



\[Then Mr. Ronald Enhes begins calling up Scouts one by one to receive their merit badges and rank advancements, with each Scout greeted by applause and cheers from their fellow troop members and proud parents.\]





\[The ceremony continues with each Scout receiving their awards, until all have been recognized.\]



Master of Ceremonies: Congratulations to all of our Scouts on your achievements! Your hard work and dedication are an inspiration to us all. As we close this evening's ceremony, let us carry the spirit of scouting with us always, and continue to live by the Scout Oath and Law in everything we do.





Master of Ceremonies: Thank you all for joining us tonight. Have a wonderful evening, and we'll see you at our next scouting adventure!
