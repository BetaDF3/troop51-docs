# 🔷 Full PLC Conduct

**PLC STUFF**  
Main points:  
\-PLC’s should be self sustaining  
\-Anyone can go to PLC  
\-Whos the scribe  
\-Roberts rules

\----------------------------  
Guiding principles:

\-Everyone has the right to participate in discussion if they wish, before anyone may speak a second time.  
\-Everyone has the right to know what is going on at all times. Only urgent matters may interrupt a speaker.  
\-Only one thing (motion) can be discussed at a time.  
\-The SPL has the power to cut off things that are not productive, and derail the meeting— This is different from normal RRO, because the chair normally is just there to run the meeting. Here, the SPL has more power to keep everything on track.

A motion is the topic under discussion (e.g., “I move that we add a coffee break to this meeting”).

After being recognized by the SPL, any member can introduce a motion when no other motion is on the table.

A motion requires a second to be considered. If there is no second, the matter is not considered. Each motion must be disposed of (passed, defeated, tabled, referred to committee, or postponed indefinitely).

The scribe needs to write down the motion, the second, and a brief summary of the motion, and the discussion that follows. The scribe should write down the outcome of the motion. This should be put in a google doc, and a short summary of the meeting should be made. This summary is called the meeting minutes, and it's what we will go over at the next meeting. A member can make a quick suggestion that something is explicitly stated in the notes, which needs to be seconded.

\----------------------  
How to do things:

**You want to bring up a new idea before the group.**  
After recognition by the SPL, present your motion.   
A second is required for the motion to go to the floor for discussion, or consideration.

**You want to change some of the wording in a motion under discussion.**  
After recognition by the president of the board, move to amend by  
\- adding words  
\- striking words  
\- striking and inserting words.

**You like the idea of a motion being discussed, but you need to reword it beyond simple word changes.**  
Move to substitute your motion for the original motion. If it is seconded, discussion will continue  
on both motions and eventually the body will vote on which motion they prefer.

**You want more study and/or investigation given to the idea being discussed.**  
Move to refer to a committee. Try to be specific as to the charge to the committee.

**You want more time personally to study the proposal being discussed.**  
Move to postpone to a definite time or date.

**You are tired of the current discussion.**  
Move to limit debate to a set period of time or to a set number of speakers. Requires a 2/3rds vote.

**You have heard enough discussion.**  
Move to close the debate. Also referred to as calling the question. This cuts off discussion and brings the assembly to a vote on the pending question only. Requires a 2/3rds vote

**You want to postpone a motion until some later time.**  
Move to table the motion. The motion may be taken from the table after 1 item of business has been conducted. If the motion is not taken from the table by the end of the next meeting, it is dead. To kill a motion at the time it is tabled requires a 2/3rds vote. A majority is required to table a motion without killing it.

**You believe the discussion has drifted away from the agenda and want to bring it back.**  
“Call for orders of the day.”

**You want to take a short break.**  
Move to recess for a set period of time.

**You want to end the meeting.**  
Move to adjourn.

**You are unsure the president of the board announced the results of a vote correctly.**  
Without being recognized, call for a “division of the house." A roll call vote will then be taken.

**You are confused about a procedure being used and want clarification.**  
Without recognition, call for "Point of Information" or "Point of Parliamentary Inquiry." The president of the board will ask you to state your question and will attempt to clarify the situation.

**You have changed your mind about something that was voted on earlier in the meeting for which you were on the winning side.**  
Move to reconsider. If the majority agrees, the motion comes back on the floor as though the vote had not occurred.

**You want to change an action voted on at an earlier meeting.**  
Move to rescind. If previous written notice is given, a simple majority is required. If no notice is given, a 2/3rds vote is required.

**Unanimous Consent**  
If a matter is considered relatively minor or opposition is not expected, a call for unanimous consent may be requested. If the request is made by others, the SPL will repeat the request and then pause for objections. If none are heard, the motion passes. 

**You may INTERRUPT a speaker for these reasons only:**

- to get information about business –point of information to get information about rules –parliamentary inquiry  
- if you can't hear, safety reasons, comfort, etc. –question of privilege  
- if you see a breach of the rules –point of order  
- if you disagree with the president of the board’s ruling –appeal  
- if you disagree with a call for Unanimous Consent –object  
- If you have a question about procedures \-usage of procedures question  
- A question about anything else for the adults \-Clarification from adults  
- **ADULTS ONLY \-** If you hear something that is not factual \-Fact check intervention

Say “I would like to interject”

In a normal RRoO meeting the Chair cannot vote. Therefore the SPL cannot vote unless to break a tie. The ASPLs are the Vice Chairs to the SPL.  
Robert’s Rules of Order was developed to ensure that meetings are fair, efficient, democratic and orderly. A skilled chairperson allows all members to voice their opinions in an orderly manner so that everyone in the meeting can hear and be heard. The following tips and reminders will help chairpersons run a successful and productive meeting without being run over or running over others.

Follow the agenda to keep the group moving toward its goals.  
Let the group do its work — don’t over-command.  
Control the flow of the meeting by recognizing members who ask to speak.  
Let all members speak once before allowing anyone to speak a second time.  
When discussions get off-track, gently guide the group back to the agenda.  
Model courtesy and respect and insist that others do the same.  
Help to develop the board’s skills in the parliamentary procedure by properly using motions and points of order.  
Encourage members to present motions positively rather than negatively.  
Give each speaker your undivided attention.  
Keep an emotional pulse on the discussions.  
Allow a consensus to have the final authority of the group.

Voting with a done by saying “all in favor say I and raise hand” and then “all not in favor say I and raise hand”

**ADULTS**  
If a scout has a question about the procedures, ask an adult with the usage of procedures question (Mr. Bennett is very knowledgeable about Roberts Rules, in most cases ask him)  
Scoutmaster, and assistant scoutmasters can make motions but cannot vote and cannot second.

Adults can interject if something is not factual\!\!

**Stages of a Meeting**

**Call to Order:** The chairperson or president officially begins the proceedings.  
**Reading and Approval of Board Meeting Minutes:** The secretary presents the minutes from the last meeting for approval by the board. The members may amend errors in the minutes.  
**Reports:** The board members view reports from executive committees, the auditor’s financial statements, investment advisor reports, and attorney reports.  
**Old Business:** Members may take further action on agenda items that were tabled from the last meeting.  
**New Business:** Members discuss and debate any new business before the board.  
Adjournment: The board chair or other facilitator calls the official end to the meeting.

**Important stuff**

### Follow these 6 steps to file a motion:

1. Motion:  A member makes a motion to bring a particular business matter to the attention of the group. For example, a member of the board may call for a [vote of no-confidence](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/blog/vote-of-no-confidence/) if they believe a board member has made decisions that were harmful to the organization.   
2. Second: Robert’s Rules only permit one topic for discussion at any time. To qualify for discussion, the primary motion must receive a second. A second indicates the willingness of at least one other person to raise the item for discussion. A second doesn’t mean the person is in favor of the motion. It just means the issue should receive debate.  
3. Restate Motion: Once an item raised for discussion receives both a motion and a second, the chairperson restates the motion and places the item before the board for discussion and a vote.  
4. Debate: The board debates the merits of the motion and listens to all perspectives in order to make an informed vote.  
5. Vote: Under parliamentary rules, meeting decisions require a majority vote. A majority vote in the affirmative decides the issue before the board. Each member of the group agrees to be bound by the decision of the majority. Sometimes a group may require a two-thirds vote or a three-fourths vote on a particular issue.    
6. Vote Announcement: Following a vote on an issue, the chairperson announces the results of the vote and the action taken. If supported by a majority vote, the motion is adopted.

Only one issue for debate at a time  
Negative motions are not allowed  
Only one person may speak at a time  
All board members have equal rights  
Each item presented for board action has a right to a full and fair debate  
Everyone must be respectful  
SPL has extra power to keep things running smoothly
