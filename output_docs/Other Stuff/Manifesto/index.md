SECTION: ONE

Some things are more important than others, air over shelter, shelter over water, water over food, It's important to know what's most important. In the case of Christmas trees, the sale is the most important. There are things you can do to increase sales but it is vital first knowing that the sale comes above all else. Here is a list from most important to least in descending order.

Safety/attendance, we can sell if you aren?t there or hurt.

The sale, if we don't sell then what's the point of anything else?

Display, this is the most important part of advertising, If no one can see stock then they will be a lot less likely to buy.

Heat, staying warm is very important if you plan to sell, move, and tie trees. If there are no customers, then you may wait in a car to warm up.

Signage, not people on the street, but signs that say we?re here. People may know we?re there, but they may not know we are open. People on the street also seem to reduce sales.

Fun, it is the least important. Even if you are with your friends everything benefits the troop, except fun. There is a time and a place for fun, when there's customers or by the road is not it.
