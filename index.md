# 🔥 Why We Moved From Google Docs to GitHub

Google Docs is great for editing, but terrible for long-term documentation.  
We moved because GitHub gives us:

- A clean website  
- Organized folders  
- Search  
- Version history  
- Stable links  
- A single source of truth  
- A structure that scales  

Editors still work in Google Docs.  
Viewers get a clean website.  
Everyone wins.
